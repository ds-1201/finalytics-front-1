point a week later, the order will be executed then. If it were a day order, it would have been
cancelled.
<br/><br/>

<h3 id="subheadratio">What are Ratios?</h3>
<p>
Ratios are one the most important component taken in place while investing in financial
instrument be it equity, bonds, private placement of shares, etc.. By looking at ratios
investors can easily interpret and evaluate financial statements of any firm without having to
go through them manually. There are tons of ratios in the vocabulary of the investors and
ratios are not rigidly defined, anyone can have there on sets of ratios that they consider
worthwhile. However, they are many ratios that are common but super useful as well. So in
this section let’s talk about them.
</p>
<h4 id="subheadratio">Liquidity Ratios</h4>
<p>Liquidity ratios are the ratios that measure the ability of a company to meet its short-term
debt obligations. These ratios measure the ability of a company to pay off its short-term
liabilities when they fall due</p>

<p>
The liquidity ratios are a result of dividing cash and other liquid assets by the short-term
borrowings and current liabilities. They show the number of times the short-term debt
obligations are covered by the cash and liquid assets. If the value is greater than 1, it means
the short-term obligations are fully covered.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the higher the liquidity ratios are, the higher the margin of safety that the company
posses to meet its current liabilities. Liquidity ratios greater than 1 indicate that the company
is in good financial health and it is less likely to fall into financial difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Different ratios under the liquidity ratios:
</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="subheadratio">Current Ratio</h4>
<p>Like the price-to-earnings ratio, the current ratio is one of the most famous of
all the financial ratios. It serves as a test of a company's financial strength and
can give you an idea of whether a company has too much or too little cash on
hand to meet its obligations.<br/>
<u>It's calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.</u>
</p>
<h4 id="subheadratio">Quick Ratio/Acid Test Ratio</h4>
<p>The quick ratio is another way of helping you determine a company's financial
 strength. It's also known as the acid test and, as the name suggests, is a more
 stringent measure of a company's ability to meet its obligations.<u>It subtracts
 out inventory from current assets before dividing by current liabilities </u>because
 a company may need a good deal of time to liquidate its inventory before the
 money can be used to cover liabilities.
 </p>
 <h4 id="subheadratio">Working Captial Ratio</h4>
 <p>Working capital is the amount by which<u>the value of a company's current assets exceeds its
 current liabilities.</u>Also called net working capital. Sometimes the term "working capital" is
 used as synonym for "current assets" but more frequently as "net working capital", i.e. the
 amount of current assets that is in excess of current liabilities. Working capital is frequently
 used to measure a firm's ability to meet current obligations. It measures how much in liquid
 assets a company has available to build its business.
 </p>

{
    "title" : "Capital Structure Ratio: ",
"body": 
    <>
<h4 id="subheadratio">Capital Structure Ratio</h4>
<p>Capital structure refers to the degree of long-term financing of a business concern as in the
 form of debentures, preference share capital, and equity share capital including reserves
 and surplus. There should be a proper mix between debt capital and equity capital. Capital
 structure is otherwise called leverage.
 </p>
 <h5 id="subheadratio">Capital Gearing Ratio</h5>
 <p>
 This ratio shows the relationship prevailing between equity share capital including reserves
 and surplus and preference share capital along with fixed interest-bearing loans for the long
 term. If equity share capital including reserves and surplus is less when compared with
 preference share capital and fixed interest-bearing loans for the long term, there is a high
 gearing and vice versa. The following formulae are used to calculate Capital Gearing Ratio.
 <br /><br />
 Capital Gearing Ratio = (Equity Share Capital + Reserves and Surplus) / (Preference Share
 Capital+ Fixed Interest bearing loans)
 </p>
 <h5 id="subheadratio">Debt To Equity</h5>
 <p>This ratio measures the claims of outsiders and the owners, i.e., shareholders against the
 assets of the firm.
 <br />
 It is also known as External-Internal Equity Ratio. It actually measures the relationship
 between the external debts/equity/outsiders fund and Internal equities/shareholders fund.
 <br/>
 In short, it expresses the relation between the external equities and internal equities or, the
 relationship between borrowed capital and the owner’s capital. It is a measure of long-term
 solvency. It reveals the claims of creditors and shareholders against the assets of the firm,
 i.e., the comparative proportion of Debts and Equity.
 <br /><br />
 Debt To Equity = Long-term Borrowings/ Shareholder’s Fund
 <br /><br />
 It expresses the relation between the external equities and internal equities or, the
 relationship between borrowed capital and the owner’s capital. It is a measure of long-term
 solvency. It reveals the claims of creditors and shareholders against the assets of the firm,
 i.e., the comparative proportion of Debts and Equity.
 </p>
 <h5 id="subheadratio">Total Asset To Debt Ratio</h5>
 <p>This ratio assesses the long-term financial position and soundness of the enterprise.
 The debt to asset ratio is a leverage ratio that measures the amount of total assets that are
 financed by creditors instead of investors. In other words, it shows what percentage of
 assets is funded by borrowing compared with the percentage of resources that are funded
 by the investors.
 <br />
 Basically it illustrates how a company has grown and acquired its assets over time.
 Companies can generate investor interest to obtain capital, produce profits to acquire its own
 assets, or take on debt. Obviously, the first two are preferable in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="subheadratio">Financial Leverage</h3>
    <p>Financial leverage is the using of equity share capital and preference share capital along
with long term fixed interest bearing debt. The company can use long term fixed interest
bearing debt very effectively. If so, the earnings of more than fixed interest is available only
to the equity shareholders. In this way, the returns to equity shareholders is increased. It
means that the earnings of equity shareholders is increased by effective use of long term
fixed interest bearing debt. It is known as trading on equity.
</p>
<p>
Financial leverage can be calculated as
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Financial leverage = Earnings Before Interest and Tax / (Earnings Before Interest
and Tax — Interest and Preference Dividend)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Operating leverage can be calculated as
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Operating leverage = (Sales — Variable Cost) / Earnings Before Interest and Tax</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined leverage can be calculated as</p>
<ul>
    <li>Combined leverage = Financial Leverage and Operating Leverage</li>

    <h3 id="subheadratio">Profitability Ratios</h3>

        <p>
        Every firm is most concerned with its profitability. One of the most frequently used tools of
financial ratio analysis is profitability ratios. They are used to determine the company's
bottom line for its managers and its return on equity to its investors. Profitability measures
are important to company managers and owners alike. <br/>Management has to have a measure
of profitability in order to steer the business in the right direction. If a business has outside
investors who have purchased stock in the company, the company management has to
show profitability to those equity investors.

  <h4 id="subheadratio"> 
  4.1 Gross Profit Margin
  </h4>
  <p>
  The gross profit margin calculates the cost of goods sold as a percent of sales—both
numbers can be found on the income statement. This ratio looks at how well a company
controls the cost of its inventory and the manufacturing of its products and subsequently
passes on the costs to its customers. The larger the gross profit margin, the better for the
company.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Calculate gross profit margin by first subtracting the cost of goods sold from sales. If sales
are $100 and the cost of goods sold is $60, the gross profit is $40. Then divide gross profit
by sales which would be: $40 / $100 = 40%. The gross profit margin, which is the amount of
sales revenue that can be devoted to utilities, inventory, and manufacturing costs is 40% of
sales
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h4 id="subheadratio">
  4.2 Operating Profit Margin
  </h4>
 
  <p>
  The operating profit is usually called earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT on a
business's income statement. The operating profit margin is EBIT as a percentage of sales.
It is a measure of a company's overall operating efficiency. It differs from the gross profit
margin by further subtracting out the expenses of ordinary, daily business activity from sales.
The operating profit margin is calculated using this formula: EBIT / Sales. If EBIT is $20 and
sales are $100, then the operating profit margin is 20%. Both terms of the equation come
from the company's income statement.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h4 id="subheadratio">
  4.3 Net Profit Margin
  </h4>

  <p>
  When doing a simple profitability ratio analysis, the net profit margin is the most often margin
ratio used. The net profit margin shows how much of each sales dollar remains as net
income after all expenses are paid. For example, if the net profit margin is 5%, that means
that 5 cents of every dollar of sales made are profit. The net profit margin measures
profitability after consideration of all expenses including taxes, interest, and depreciation.
The calculation is: Net Income / Net Sales =_%. Both terms of the equation come from the
income statement.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h4 id="subheadratio">
  4.4 Cash Flow Margin
  </h4>
    <p>
    The cash flow margin ratio is an important ratio as it expresses the relationship between
cash generated from operations and sales. The company needs cash to pay dividends,
suppliers, service debt, and invest in new capital assets, so cash is just as important as profit
to a business firm. The Cash Flow Margin ratio measures the ability of a firm to translate
sales into cash. The calculation is Cash From Operating Cash Flows / Net Sales = _%. The
numerator of the equation comes from the firm's Statement of Cash Flows. The denominator
comes from the Income Statement.
